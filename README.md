# Movie Web Scraper/Recommender

Welcome to the Movie Web Scraper/Recommender project! This repository houses a Java-based application for web scraping movie information and a Python-based application for generating personalized movie recommendations.

## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to scrape movie details from popular websites like IMDb, organize the data into `.txt` and `.csv` files, and provide a user-friendly interface for movie recommendations based on the scraped dataset.

## Features

### Web Scraping (Java)
- **HTML & CSS Parsing**: Learn how to read and interpret HTML and CSS tags.
- **Data Extraction**: Utilize loops and conditionals to parse repetitive elements and extract specific data using tags, IDs, and classes.
- **CSV Creation**: Generate `.csv` files to store the scraped data efficiently.

### Data Handling & Recommendation (Python)
- **Data Manipulation with Pandas**: Clean and process the scraped data by removing null values and adding index columns.
- **Cosine Similarity for Recommendations**: Employ `sklearn` to create a cosine similarity matrix for text-based movie recommendations.
- **Web Interface with Flask**: Build a dynamic web interface using Flask, integrating basic HTML and CSS files with Jinja2 templates.

## Project Learnings
- Effective HTML and CSS parsing techniques
- Advanced data extraction and sorting methods
- Comprehensive CSV file creation and manipulation
- Implementation of recommendation algorithms using cosine similarity
- Building dynamic web applications with Flask and Jinja2

## Future Enhancements
- **Attribute-Based Recommendations**: Develop features to provide recommendations based on specific movie attributes like genre, rating, and MPAA rating.
- **Advanced Sorting Options**: Enable users to sort recommendation results according to their preferences.

Stay tuned for more updates and features!
