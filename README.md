# Movie Web Scraper

Java-based application for a Movie Web Scraping project. 

The goal is to scrape movie information from websites like IMDb, organize it in a .txt and .csv files, and 
offer users a user-friendly interface to explore movies with features like ratings, reviews, trailers, and 
recommendations based on different inputs like cast members or titles.

Learned how to:
- Read a website's HTML and CSS tags
- Parse through repeated generic elements using for each loops
- Parsed the website using tags, IDs, and classes in order to specify scrapped elements
- Comparator and how to implement different sorts based on different types (i.e rating, duration, etc.)
- Create a .csv file in Java

What's Next:
- Implement the UI using SpringBoot
- Debug Movie class to ensure optimal scanning
- Implement filtered lists methods allowing to filter based on features
- Use basic NLP to allow recommendations based on movie descriptions or actor
